= jscribd

* 1.0 (June 11, 2010)

== DESCRIPTION:

jscribd is a Java library for interacting with the Scribd API. For more information on
the Scribd platform, visit http://www.scribd.com/developers/api

== FEATURES:

* Upload your documents to Scribd's servers
* Upload local files or from remote web sites
* Search, tag, and organize documents
* Associate documents with your users' accounts

== BUILDING:

To build the jscribd jar, run:

  $ ant dist

You'll find the jar in:

  dist/lib

== GETTING STARTED:

First, you'll need to get a Scribd API account. Visit
http://www.scribd.com/developers/api to apply for a platform account.

On the Platform site you will be given an API key and secret. The API object
will need these to authenticate you, so setup the following environment variables:

  $ export SCRIBD_API_KEY=[api-key]
  $ export SCRIBD_API_SECRET=[api-secret]

  Scribd scribd = new Scribd();

Alternatively, you can pass your API key and secret into the ScribdApi constructor:

  Scribd scribd = new Scribd(new ScribdApi("[api-key]", "[api-secret]"));

Next, log into Scribd:

  ScribdUser user = scribd.getApi().login("[username]", "[password]");

You are now ready to use Scribd to manage your documents. For instance, to
upload a document:

  Map<String, Object> attributes = new HashMap<String, Object>();
  attributes.put("access", "private");
  File file = new File("[path-to-file]");
  ScribdDocument uploadDoc = new ScribdDocument(scribd.getApi(), file, user, attributes);
  uploadDoc.save();

== REQUIREMENTS:

* A Scribd API account
* The following libraries (included in lib):
 * apache-mime4j-0.6.jar
 * commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
 * httpclient-4.0.jar
 * httpcore-4.0.1.jar
